Hello Petrus

I would rate your job 67% based on 

- Replicating the exact image sent
- patience to do it again

The remaining faults would be based on

- There are some ideological ideas as a webdeveloper that needed to be conceived on the page as there where no hyperlinks on the page even if they are not redirecting anywhere

- The background image with #E0D48A should have been a full auto width as the image sent was just a cut 

- i believe with time on my end i will lay out proper instructions on what is meant to be done




New Project

Here in the folder is an image containing the a windows image where you are meant to

- Replicate the image in basic html and css
- learn how to achieve the image
- hover on each icon on the image to create a hover effect with any color
- learn install font icons and place the icons according to the image
- how you develop does not matter to me just replicate and make it as easy and simple to read with indentations included
